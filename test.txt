gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. Write spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or stdout. Or simply pre-generate Google Translate TTS request URLs to feed to an external program.
